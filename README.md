# ML Prediction App (Streamlit) 🌐🤖

A beginner-friendly end-to-end Machine Learning project built using **Python**, **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit**.  
This app loads a trained ML model (`model.pkl`) and provides a clean Streamlit interface to make real-time predictions from user input.
